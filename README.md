A Github repository for my Honors Thesis â€“ a genetic simulation programmed and designed with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap

About the simulation
-
This simulation is designed to demonstrate gene flow in a finite population. Each cell in the grid represents an individual in the population, and its color represents a unique allele. As the simulations runs, you can obverse the allele frequencies in the population shifting as the colors of individual cells change over time.

Running the simulation
-
+ To begin the simulation, press "Start"
+ The stop the simulation, press "Pause"
+ To randomly generate a new initial population and begin the simulation again, press "Reset"
+ To adjust the mutation rate used by the simulation, edit the text field to the left of "Start"
+ To generate a JSON representation of the population at a given point, press "Export" while the simulation is paused. To see a description of the JSON format, see "JSON format" below.
+ To apply a barrier to a cell on the grid, simply click on the cell. To learn more about barriers, see "Barriers" below.
+ To apply a barrier template to the entire grid, press "Template." To learn more about creating your own templates, see "Barriers" below.
+ To force a mutation to occur on a cell, click on the cell while holding the SHIFT key. To learn more about mutations, see "Mutations" below.
