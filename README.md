Topic Overview
--------------

JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are the building blocks of modern web applications. Because applications written in JavaScript can be compiled and run in
a web browser, they can be quickly deployed to any device equipped with a modern browser. This makes JavaScript a useful programming language for a
developer looking to make tools for the classroom. To take advantage of tools written in JavaScript, instructors need not download an application,
install third party software, or attach additional hardware – they can simply run the tool in their web browser of choice. For ease of use and
quick adoption, JavaScript is thus ideal for creating simulations and visualizations that can be used in a classroom or lecture environment as a
demonstrative aid.

One use case for a JavaScript simulation is an application to allow students to visualize genetic change as it occurs in a finite population. Using
a Moran Model, it is possible to simulate the fluctuation of genetic diversity throughout a population of spatially isolated individuals, and the
previously mentioned web technologies would allow for such a simulation to be presented in a manner that is clearly understandable to someone new
to the topic. These technologies are further ideal because they allow instructors who wish to demonstrate the genetic diversity of a population to
deploy the application in a convenient manner, without disrupting the regular flow of instruction.

Research Plan
-------------

I will create the model described above by using HTML and CSS to create a web site that displays a sample population of 1024 individuals. The
population will be represented as a grid of squares, while each individual will be represented with a different color. Users will be able to watch
as specific alleles spread through a population by observing the change in colors of specific grid cells as subsequent generations replace
individuals in the population. While HTML and CSS will be used for the visualization, the simulation itself will be designed with JavaScript.
Following Agile software engineering practices, I will iterate on the implementation and design of the application in weekly sprints, constantly
responding to feedback from my Director and updating the application to meet current requirements. I will subsequently summarize the web site’s
application, its typical use case, the development process, and any findings I may come across using and designing the application into a
comprehensive report.
